Firewall mutation v1.0, by obez - 2016-08-xx

Changelog ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.0 (2016-08-xx)
    - Initial release

Info --------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little mutation idea we had while playing Tank Arena with friends.

Bar the route of other players so they get mobbed by tanks or simply burn your
friends to death.

Last player alive scores 1 point.

Guns don't deal damage to players, only molotovs do.

Fire deals the same damage in all difficulties (Expert damage).

Only temporary health is allowed (Medkits and defibrillators are removed).

No incap or ledge grab, death.

Use the command "!stats" in chat to display players statistics (points, kills,
deaths) in the console.

Restarting the campaign resets the scores to 0.

Survivor voices for tank warning and molotov throw are muted, to allow more
stealth. Players halos are also disabled.

1 Molotov is randomly spawned every 10s at existing molotovs positions.

The mutation was designed to be played with Tank Arena but it should work with
all the coop maps.
